  p1: Nicolas Riquette is a Belgian artist, born in Namur in 1988. He lives and works in Brussels.
  p2: Bruxelles-Ecole Supérieure des Arts in 2015 with a master's degree in plastic, visual and spatial arts, with a major in sculpture. He is developing a plastic universe intrinsically linked to the notion of space. Winner of the Laurent Moonens Prize 2015, Nicolas Riquette will deepen his reflection during his nine-month residency in the house of the Moonens Foundation. While working individually and participating in group exhibitions, Nicolas Riquette then devoted himself to the development of a collaborative work with the visual artist Claire Ducène, entitled "Endless House". Between 2016 and 2020, the Collective will hold several exhibitions in Brussels, notably at the Hectolitre and Maison Pelgrims, and elsewhere, including the Sart Tilman site in Liège. In the summer of 2021, the Moonens Foundation will once again welcome Nicolas Riquette for a three-month residency, at the end of which the project "Incipit - Solo show Nicolas Riquette" will be unveiled. Incipit" will be the starting point of a practice combining sculptures, installations, furnishings and images from his own universe.
  p3: More details ...
  p4: Nicolas Riquette's plastic preoccupations revolve around notions linked to the exhibition context. Very often, this context is more important than the object itself. Whether it is an image, an object or a large-scale installation, the real purpose lies in the relationship with the viewer. In concrete terms, Nicolas Riquette's works question the concepts of "frame", "base", and more broadly "scenography". His drawings take on the appearance of plans, sketches or exhibition views. His objects evoke unstructured frames or plinths, architectural models, unfinished clay models or structures halfway between furniture and buildings. His installations are conceived as drawings in space and often made without any prior plan. Sketches of labyrinthine architectures, somewhere between a building site and a ruin, they come to life when visitors walk through them. Above all, they underline the act of building. For Nicolas Riquette, every architectural structure is a metaphor for a structure of thoughts.
  p5: Intimately linked to the exhibition space, the artist's works are created according to a precise location. Nicolas Riquette draws on the codes of shapes, colours and materials of the host venue to generate "forms" that function both individually and within the exhibition as a whole.
  p6: From objects that are actually tangible or visible only in photographs, to drawings revealing objects that no longer exist or do not yet exist, to videos showing objects hidden in the large installations, to works made with the creations of other artists, Nicolas Riquette's works interact and often end up merging with each other. The question underlying the whole reflection is linked to the influence that the "context" can have on the final appearance of an object qualified as a "work of art".

work:
  p1: Co-founder of the Endless House Collective, Nicolas Riquette has been working since 2016 with Claire Ducène to develop a project that has already seen several incarnations in various places charged with history.
  p2: Nicolas Riquette has also participated in several collective projects.
  p3: Nicolas Riquette's first large-scale solo exhibition, "Incipit - Solo Show Nicolas Riquette, which will open on Saturday 28 August 2021, will mark the beginning of his personal visual career.
  
  incipit:
    main_intro:
      p1: The incipit usually refers to the first words, or paragraphs, of a literary work. It sets the scene for the rest of the text, defines the genre and announces the point of view adopted by the narrator and the author's stylistic choices.  
      p2: INCIPIT - SOLO SHOW Nicolas Riquette is the first large-scale solo exhibition of the visual artist Nicolas Riquette. 
      p3: The entire exhibition is structured around notions of the exhibition context. This context is often more important than the object itself. Whether it is an image, an object or an installation, the real purpose lies in the relationship to the viewer. The works in the exhibition explore the relationship between surface and space, image and object, original and representation. The exhibition reveals details of the artist's preliminary creative process, elevates the studio space to the status of an art object, and sanctifies anecdotal acts of studio practice. In concrete terms, the works in the exhibition question the concepts of "frame", "base", and more broadly "scenography". The drawings evoke sketches or exhibition views, and the objects are frames or unstructured pedestals, architectural models, unfinished models or structures halfway between furniture and buildings. The installations, conceived as drawings in space, made without a prior plan, are sketches of labyrinthine architectures that come to life when they are walked through by visitors. Above all, they emphasise the act of building. For Nicolas Riquette, every architectural structure is a metaphor for a structure of thoughts. The exhibition space is essential. Nicolas Riquette draws on the codes of forms, colours and materials of the host venue to generate his "forms", but also draws inspiration from the function and past of the place. Developing in the house of the Moonens Foundation, the "Incipit" concept thus combines the practice of Nicolas Riquette with the work of Laurent Moonens.The works of Nicolas Riquette are in dialogue with each other and often end up merging with each other. The question underlying the whole reflection is linked to the influence that the "context" can have on the final appearance of an object qualified as a "work of art". If the exhibition can be understood as an overall work, each element can be decontextualised and exist autonomously. The incipit is only the beginning of a much larger work, but it contains the premises of all that will one day be.

    intro:
      p1: As an introduction, INCIPIT - INSTALLATION outlines the lines of thought that are developed on the floors of the house.
      p2: 1. BASED proposes 6 objects that are closely linked to their base. Some forms are too flexible and need the base and its cables to exist. The luminous "soft" form and the organic gold ring form could take on many aspects and are subject to the influence of the cables that support them.Other concepts require a circular movement or a constant breath to convey their message. The wooden ball, subjected to a cyclical movement, offers an unpredictable and constantly changing spectacle. The golden form, fluttering in the wind, generates an elusive image through its blurred glass window. Others would not be complete without their display case, as significant as the object it contains. It is the water that allows this concrete sphere to remain in place at mid-height. The unfinished clay model remains wet, and therefore malleable, because of its display case. However it is inaccessible. The term "sculpture" can refer to an object, but also to a practice as a whole.
      p3: 2. The BUILDINGS exhibited behind the interior windows underline the importance of the act of building. The assembly, often spontaneous, without any prior plan, is central to the work of Nicolas Riquette. Every architectural construction can be interpreted as a structure of thoughts. 
      p4: 3. FRAME and UNFRAMED represent the two extremes of Nicolas Riquette's formal repertoire. If one is a wooden and glass frame, unstructured but still extremely rigorous, the other is an anarchic imbrication of a painter's canvas that evolves from a flat surface to a three-dimensional object. Sometimes the frame wants to replace the work, sometimes it is the support of the latter that takes its place.
      p5: 4. SET UP (object), in connection with the performance SET UP presented on a screen at the back of the staircase, evokes the many influences that determine the final appearance of an art object. The appearance of this clay form was gradually shaped by the process of scenographic research.
      p6: 5. SOME FLOWERS BEHIND A WHITE GRID and STILL LIFE BEHIND BLURRED GLAS combine works by Laurent Moonens with the plastic practice of Nicolas Riquette. The composition of "Pink & green bouquet" is completely reinterpreted by a small white grid with multiple "frames" of different dimensions.The perception of "Bottles and wine glass" is modified by the cathedral glass of its precarious frame. The lines become blurred, the whole still life tends towards abstraction. 
      p7: 6. 25 individually framed A4 sheets constitute a drawing, close to a preparatory sketch, entitled FRAME ANALYSIS. It confirms Nicolas Riquette's formal repertoire while evoking the codes of the GRID installation on the first floor. FRAME ANALYSIS also underlines the importance of the back and forth between surface and space, image and object, original and representation.

    weaving:
      p1: The term weaving literally refers to the scenographic ensemble of works that takes place in the stairwell of the house, between the ground floor and the top floor. 
      p2: Beginning with a video performance and culminating in large wall assemblages, via numerous small objects and images, the installation evokes the progressive development of a plastic project and the evolution of a formal and conceptual research. 
      p3: The performance SET UP (video) tends to underline, with a slight degree of self-mockery, the importance of the involuntary, uncontrollable (and often undesirable) influences of the exhibition process on the final appearance of an art object.
      p4: The layering of objects presented by DISPLAY CASE evokes the emergence of disparate ideas that can occur at the beginning of a new art project.
      p5: The composition of wall works STUDIES FOR FRAMES offers a sample of a formal research that would have led to objects such as FABRIC FRAME (Blue) or PAINTED FRAME (Blue), as well as the other FRAMES in the exhibition.

    grid:
      p1: The void is not nothing
      p2: Based on notions of theoretical physics, the installation evokes a tangible void.
      p3: Like the dark matter that underlies our universe, a white structure supports the exhibition space. It guides the spectator and rationalises the three-dimensional space.
      p4: If Georges Braque spoke of the vase as being capable of giving form to the void, the grid is a scenographic structure that places objects moulded from different materials. These mouldings are made from various cans from the artist's current practice. These objects, which are usually empty and intended to contain a specific material, are here massive and composed of various materials. Based on the foundations of the practice of moulding, this series of objects symbolises the void to make it palpable.
      p5: On the wall, the installation hosts drawings showing exhibition spaces awaiting their works, structured by a white grid in reserve, which are all analyses of this interaction that exists between the space and the elements it hosts, between the container and the content.
      p6: It is a reflection on the links between the three-dimensional physical space and the surface as a space of representation, a portal to an intangible place.

    vestibule1:
      p1: Linking the GRID and RELIQUAIRIES installations, FULL/EMPTY is a cardboard box filled with photographs representing the emptiness of the same box. 
      p2: Alongside this cardboard box, PLASTER CUBE PATTERN proposes a version, frozen in plaster, of an unfolded cube. The three-dimensional object tends towards the two-dimensional image, borrowing the materials of sculpture but taking over the exhibition space of the wall works. 
      p3: PALIMPSEST reveals a set of non-figurative compositions elaborated from old commercial images. This quadriptych refers to Nicolas Riquette's creative process, which relies on the codes of forms, colours and materials of an existing entity to create a new one.
      p4: Introducing the next installation, entitled RELIQUAIRIES, each of the three boxes in the "Laurent Moonens RELIQUAIRIES" series contains a hidden sculpture, directly inspired by the work of Laurent Moonens, of which the front of the box is a reproduction printed on wood. The work is inaccessible, only its overall dimensions are imaginable. The descriptions offered by the framed certificates of authenticity are there to offer a mental image of the hidden object.
    
    reliquaries:
      p1: In the centre of the room, a construction of unstructured bases presenting nine wooden boxes, covered with tiles drawing a grid on all sides. 
      p2: Inside each "reliquary" is an object whose three maximum dimensions, length, width and height, are indicated by the measurements of the box. 
      p3: The "hidden objects", manufactured, evoke architectural or urban research models or even projects for scenographic structures. 
      p4: The final work is not only the hidden assembly but the whole that it forms with its sealed box. 
      p5: On the walls of the room, the nine framed certificates of authenticity offer meticulous descriptions of each hidden object to allow the viewer to sketch a mental image of the contents of each box. 
      p6: By rationalising the space occupied by an art object, this spatial reflection addresses notions of scenography and the design of an artwork; but it also deals with certain aspects of the art market context by removing the work from direct view.

    echo_2021:
      p1: Drawing on the codes of shapes, colours and materials of the "host space", a "guest space" is developed in studio 4. Visitors are invited to wander through this reorganised space, combining construction wood and recovered wood according to a strict protocol.  This archi-sculpture is a scenographic structure that hosts objects and drawings exploring similar directions, as so many layers of an echo.
      p2: The wooden models of the FRAMING MODELS series evoke other spatial configurations that the installation could have adopted in situ. They develop the same concerns at other scales.
      p3: The drawings in the FRAMES DRAWINGS series address similar concerns but placed to the two-dimensional space of the sheet of paper.
      p4: Finally, as the ECHO concept is intended to be open to other artists, the installation hosts three works by Laurent Moonens that function according to similar formal codes.

    vestibule2:
      p1: Sacralising the artist's work space, DUSTY WORKSHOP is a silk-screen print representing the workshop in which the works in the exhibition were created, made from dust collected in the same workshop. 
      p2: PROJECT FOR A SCULPTURE WITH "Head 1", which introduces the installation PLATEFORME, combines a reproduction of Laurent Moonens' "Head 1" felt pen on paper, on Plexiglas, with a block placed on a pedestal. The installation evokes the preliminary work of the sculptor who prepares his work material by drawing his subject on the sides of his block. Here too, the two-dimensional work borrows certain codes from sculpture and tends to evolve into a three-dimensional object.

    platform:
      p1: Of rather domestic dimensions, the scenography of the installation PLATFORM is articulated around objects from the series FURNITURE. On, in and around these objects, which are halfway between furniture and sculpture, are objects that are based on the links between the flat surface and the three-dimensional space, the image and the object, the original and the representation.
      p2: BLACK BENCH, BLACK CABINET and TRIPOD DRAWER structure the space in the company's latest studio.
      p3: GOLDEN BACKGROUND is a survival blanket with only its golden side. This blanket is a two-dimensional object in terms of its dimensions, but it could also function as a sculpture, as it has more than just one side to offer. 
      p4: RED COLUMN, on the other hand, is a sculpture that could almost function as an image, as it is almost identical regardless of the viewer's position.
      p5: 1m³ IN A BOX disrupts our spatial representations by confronting two objects of different sizes. A cube of fabric, one cubic metre in size, is summarily folded to fit the space imposed on it by a small steel box of A4 format.
      p6: FRAME and its drawn alter ego underline the importance for Nicolas Riquette of the links between tangible object and drawn representation.
      p7: GOLDENG FRAMING and BLUE FRAMING further extrapolate the movement initiated by FRAMES.
      p8: PORCELAIN GRID, BLUE GROUND and MARBLE TABLE offer back and forth between objects and images.
      p9: PLEASE, DO NOT TOUCH finally proposes to sanctify a detail of the classic exhibition context, namely the "Please, do not touch ..." sign.
